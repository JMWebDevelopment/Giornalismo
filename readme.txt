== Description ==
Give your site the look of a newspaper front page, but with a modern day look. With Giornalismo, your readers will know about everything going on with a top story section and up to three columns full of stories right up front. Once inside, it will be easy for readers to know the important details, with story highlights, and navigate within the site, with related stories and latest posts. Giornalismo is completely responsive, allowing readers to take your stories wherever they go.

== Installation ==
= Via WordPress Admin =
- From your sites admin, go to Themes > Install Themes.
- In the search box, type 'Giornalismo' and press enter.
- Locate the entry for 'Giornalismo' (there should be only one) and click the 'Install' link.
- When installation is finished, click the 'Activate' link.

= Manual Install =
- Download the file from the theme page.
- Unzip the file.
- Using an FTP client (I recommend FireZilla), upload the 'giornalismo' file to your Wordpress theme folder. Make sure the file you upload simply says 'Giornalismo' with no numbers after it. Otherwise, it won't work.
- Go into your Wordpress Admin, navigate to 'Appearance > Themes'.
- Find the Giornalismo listing on this page and click 'Activate'.

== Features ==
= Menus =
Giornalismo comes with up to two menus for your liking. The main menu is always displayed between the header section and the main body of each page. The top menu is optional and can be set to be shown in the WordPress Customizer under the "General Settings" tab.

= Custom Header =
While the suggested practice is to let the header be the site title and description, there is the option to upload a custom header image. To upload the image, go to Appearance->Header in the WordPress admin area. For the best display, header images should be 530px by 150px.

= Featured Photos =
This theme relies a lot on featured photos and it is recommended that each post comes with a featured photo. The optimal size for featured photos is 735px by 440px.

= Customizable Homepage =
Giornalismo leaves a number of options open to users, including the homepage. Users can completely customize what posts show up in the homepage and where they show up. Each column can either display posts from a category or the latest posts in order and each column can show a different number of posts. Users can also select which category shows up in the top story slot at the top. All of these options can be found in the WordPress Customizer under the "Homepage Options" tab.

= Sidebars =
There are a couple of different options when it comes to the sidebars. There's the generic right sidebar layout, then there's the left sidebar layout and finally there's the two sidebar layout. It is important to note that if the two sidebar layout is in use, the third column on the home page will not appear.

= Story Highlights =
One of the best features your readers will enjoy is the story highlights feature. Shown at the top of the post right underneath the post meta, you can enter up to three key points for each story. This will highlight the most important parts of the story so the reader knows what's going on. To implement this feature, install the "Giornalismo Story Details" plugin (see the How To's section).

= Post Details =
In addition to the story highlights, Giornalismo also has spots for a photo credit and caption for featured photos and a spot to place an embedded video in place of a featured photo. Like the story highlights, you will need to install the "Giornalismo Story Details" plugin. To make the YouTube embed work, on the YouTube video you want to embed, click share, embed and copy the source link. Make sure the url has the "/embed/" in the middle of it.

= Related Stories/Latest Stories =
Want the readers to be able to dig deeper into your content without adding another plugin? Giornalismo has that covered. The theme has the ability to show related stories and latest stories from a category on the single post view. To implement these features, select the respective checkboxes in the "General Settings" tab of the WordPress Customizer.

= Staff Page =
Giornalismo also has a special staff page template to show off your staff of however many peope you have. To create this page, add a new page and select "Staff" in the template dropdown menu.

= Header Ads =
There is a spot in the upper right hand side of the header for a widget area. This spot is recommended for ads if you wish. To implement this feature, see the "Header Ads" How To section.

= Breaking News =
Giornalismo also comes with built-in support for the "JM Breaking News" plugin. Simply install the plugin (details in the How To's section), and create a new breaking news post and set a time limit. The banner will show up without having to add any code.

= Breadcrumbs =
Let your readers know where they are on your site with breadcrumbs at the top of the page. Click the checkbox in the "General Settings" tab of the WordPress Customizer to implement this feature.

= Social Links =
Social media is everything these days and Giornalismo makes it easy to display links to your social media pages. Just enter your links in the respective text boxes in the "Social Options" section in the WordPress Customizer and the links will automatically show in the header. The theme currently supports Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and RSS feed options with more social media sites to come down the road.

= Editor Styles =
Also, with Giornalismo you'll know exactly how your theme is going to look from the font to the link color to blockquotes and tables. Everything will be styled in the editor exactly as it will be on the page.

= Author Details =
Lastly, allow your writers to talk about and promote themselves. Giornalismo has support for author bios, photos and social media links at the bottom of each post as well as on the staff page template. Install the "Extra User Details" and follow the directions in the "Author Details" part of the How To's section.

== How To's ==

Video tutorials are available on the theme page at http://jacobmartella.com/giornalismo-wordpress-theme

= Setting up the Giornalismo Story Details Plugin =
- In the WordPress Dashboard, go to Plugins->Add New.
- Search for "Giornalismo Story Details" and install and activate the plugin.
- In the post editor screen, the write panel should show up below the editor.
- For the YouTube video field, the link must be from the url bar at the top of the browser. This is different from the video tutorial on for this theme and plugin.

= Setting up the JM Breaking News Plugin =
- In the WordPress Dashboard, go to Plugins->Add New.
- Search for "JM Breaking News" and install and activate the plugin.
- Add a new breaking news post. The title is the text that will be on the banner. Add the link if there is one, determine if the link should open in a new window and set a time length for the banner to show on the site.

= Setting up the Simple Ads Manager =
- In the WordPress Dashboard, go to Plugins->Add New.
- Search for "Simple Ads Manager" and install and activate the plugin.
- Create a new ad place and enter a custom height and width. The height and width needs to be 340px by 100px.
- After saving the place, click "Ad Places" on the left, then hover over the ad and click "New Ad".
- Then either upload an image or input code and save.
- Then go to the "Widgets" section, add the "Ads Place" widget to the "Header Right" sidebar and select the ad place. The ad(s) should then show up in the header.

= Setting up the Extra User Details Plugin =
- In the WordPress Dashboard, go to Plugins->Add New.
- Search for "Extra User Details" and install and activate the plugin.
- Go to Users->Extra User Details to add the extra fields.
- The field name can be anything you want it, but you must use the following meta keys for it to work: facebook, twitter-link, twitter-handle, google-plus and author-position.
- The fields will show up on the author's profile page in the admin and the links will show up in the author bios on the front end once they are filled out.

= Setting up the Category Color Plugin =
- In the WordPress Dashboard, go to Plugins->Add New.
- Search for "Category" and install and activate the plugin.
- Go to Posts->Categories and click on the category you want to edit.
- Select a color for the category. Be sure to have wp_debug set to "false" to avoid errors being printed on the site.
- The color currently only shows up on the home page.

= Setting up a Child Theme =
When customizing a theme, the best practice is to create a child theme. This way, when you update the parent theme, all of your changes will still remain intact. Creating a child theme is very simple if you use the steps below.
- Using your preferred FTP client, navigate to the "themes" directy inside the "wp-content" directory and create a directory titled "giornalismo-child".
- Once there, create a style.css file and add the following lines of code in there and save.
	/*
	Theme Name: Giornalimso Child
	Description: Child theme for Giornalismo theme
	Author: <Your Name>
	Template: giornalismo
	*/
- Then create a functions.php file and add the following code and save.
	<?php function giornalismo_child_theme_styles() {
		wp_enqueue_style( 'main_css', get_stylesheet_uri() );
	}
	add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'giornalismo_child_theme_styles', 10 ); ?>

= Customization Guide =
This section is a complete guide to the CSS classes that you can use to customize the theme. All of these CSS classes center around individual categories and their slugs.
- .top-menu .category-{category-slug}, .main-menu .category-{category-slug}
	- These classes will add a different background for the specific category in either menu. In order for the changes you make in the CSS to work with menus, go to the menu section in the WordPress Admin, go to screen options and make sure 'CSS Classes' is checked and save. Then in the menu item you want to change the background, or other aspect, add the 'category-{category-slug}'' part into the CSS classes.
- .category-{category-slug} .label-head
	- This class affects the label head for a category when that category is selected for a column.
- .category-{category-slug}.label-head
	- This class affects the label head for a story in a specific category when a column does not have a category selected for it.
- .category-{category-slug} .read-more
	- This class affects the read more for all posts in a sepcific category.
- .breadcrumbs li.category-{category-slug}
	- This class affects the list item for both the story and it's specific category in the breadcrumbs section.
- .category-{category-slug} .title
	- This class affects the title for stories in a specific category.
- .category-{category-slug}
	- This class affects everything about posts in a specific category.

Obviously there are more ways to customize the theme and some digging around in the CSS and template files will turn those up. But these are the basic changes you might want to try to make your site unique.


'/*
Theme Name: Giornalimso Child
Description: Child theme for Giornalismo theme
Author: Giornalismo
Template: giornalismo
*/'
- Then create a functions.php file and add the following code and save.
'<?php function giornalismo_child_theme_styles() {
	wp_enqueue_style( 'main_css', get_stylesheet_uri() );
}
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'giornalismo_child_theme_styles', 10 ); ?>'
- Any template files, such as header.php or single.php, in this directory will override the parent template files. Any style changes will also override the parent theme.
